Ideas for hack
====

### UX flow:
 1. User goes to local eatery and wants a seat
 2. User opens app and scans qr code
 3. qr code sends info about the specific restaurant that is packaged in json with a get request
 4. App goes to form to fill out user name, table size, and payment info (braintree/paypal)
 5. When seat is open, server will notify phone of the open seat.
 6. Phone will have option to add a tip during the meal

### extra stuff:
- use yelp
- real time specific table info
